QuaZIP changes

* 2012-01-14 0.4.4
        * Fixed isSequential() test that was causing open() failures on
          Unix.
        * Fixed sub-directory compressing in JlCompress.
        * Added MS VS 2008 solution, compatible with the binary Qt
          distribution (tested on MS VS 2008 Express, had to run MOC
          manually due to the lack of plugin in Express).
        * Fixed extracting directories in JlCompress.
        * Fixed JlCompress.h includes in the test suite, which used
          lowercase names thus breaking on case-sensitive systems.
        * Implemented missing QuaZipFile::getZip() that was only
          declared.
        * Fixed reopening closed files.
        * Fixed possible memory leak in case of open error.

* 2011-09-09 0.4.3
        * New test suite using QTestLib.
        * Fixed bytesAvailable(), pos() and atEnd().
        * Added ZIP v1.0 support and disabling data descriptor for
          compatibility with some older software.
        * Fixed DLL export/import issues for some symbols.
        * Added QUAZIP_STATIC macro for compiling as a static library or
          directly including the source.
        * Added getFileNameList() and getFileInfoList() convenience
          functions.
        * Added some buffering to JlCompress to improve performance.

* 2011-08-10 0.4.2
        * Cmake patch (thanks to Bernhard Rosenkraenzer).
        * Symbian patch (thanks to Hamish Willee).
        * Documented the multiple files limitation of QuaZipFile.
        * Fixed relative paths handling in JlCompress.
        * Fixed linking to MinGW zlib.

* 2011-05-26 0.4.1
        * License statement updated to avoid confusion. GPL license
        removed for the very same reason.
        * Parts of original package are now clearly marked as modified,
        just as their license requires.

* 2011-05-23 0.4
        * QuaZip and QuaZipFile classes now use the Pimpl idiom. This
        means that future releases will probably be binary compatible
        with this one, but it also means that this one is binary
        incompatible with the old ones.
        * IO API has been rewritten using QIODevice instead of standard
        C library. Among other things it means that QuaZip now supports
        files up to 4 GB in size instead of 2 GB.
        * Added QuaZip methods allowing access to ZIP files represented
        by any seekable QIODevice implementation (QBuffer is a good
        example).

* 2010-07-23 0.3
        * Fixed getComment() for global comments.
        * Added some useful classes for calculating checksums (thanks to
        Adam Walczak).
        * Added some utility classes for working with whole directories
        (thanks to Roberto Pompermaier). It would be nice if someone
        documents these in English, though.
        * Probably fixed some problems with passwords (thanks to Vasiliy
        Sorokin). I didn't test it, though.

* 2008-09-17 0.2.3
        * Fixed license notices in sources.

* SVN
        * Fixed a small bug in QuaZipFile::atEnd().

* 2007-01-16 0.2.2
        * Added LGPL as alternative license.
        * Added FAQ documentation page.

* 2006-03-21 0.2.1
        * Fixed setCommentCodec() bug.
        * Fixed bug that set month 1-12 instead of 0-11, as specified in
          zip.h.
        * Added workaround for Qt's bug that caused wrong timestamps.
        * Few documentation fixes and cosmetic changes.

* 2005-07-08 0.2
        * Write support.
        * Extended QuaZipFile API, including size(), *pos() functions.
        * Support for comments encoding/decoding.

* 2005-07-01 0.1
        * Initial version.
