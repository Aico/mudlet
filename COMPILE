Compiling Mudlet 2.0
---------------------

Use the Qt-4.6-SDK package from ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qtsdk/ or http://qt.nokia.com 
It comes with a binary distribution of the libs a ready made compiler for windows (mingw)  
(NOTE GNU/Linux: If you experience instability or weird behaviour of Mudlet link against the SDK libs instead of your distro's qt libs.)

1. DEPENDENCIES: 
================
required libs to compile Mudlet:
- Qt >=4.4 (included in the SDK)
- liblua-5.1 
- libpcre-7.8 or later
- yajl-1.0 (you can also use yajl-2.0 if you change make config file src/src.pro and include lua_yajl.c instead of lua_yajl1.c)
- hunspell
- boost (www.boost.org)
- zlib.1.2.3
- Open GL libs + Qt OpenGL module see Qt OpenGL docs for more info
- zzlib (http://zziplib.sourceforge.net)
- luazip (Lua unzip module) http://www.keplerproject.org/luazip/
- Lua File System (LFS)
- rex_pcre (Lua pcre interface)
- Lua sql (Lua module for SQL)

(NOTE: GNU/Linux: You'll always need the "dev" versions of the required libs if you use packages of your distro.)

additional packages that should be present on your system to get the full feature set of Mudlet:
(NOTE: Mudlet checks if these pacakges are available at runtime and can do without them if they cannot be found in the Lua path of your system. Check Mudlet's startup messages when connecting to see if Mudlet can find these extra packages.))
- luasql (http://www.keplerproject.org/luasql/)
- lrexlib (http://lrexlib.luaforge.net/) NOTE: You only need to compile the pcre module. The other modules of this lib are not used.
- sqlite3


2. COMPILING:
=============
  Use qmake. You can adjust the paths to the dependencies in the project file
   mudlet/src/src.pro - simply look at the top of the file and adjust the paths you find to
   your own system. This is easy. If compile breaks with an error your paths are not correct.
   After having adjusted src.pro:
   make clean 
   qmake-qt4 (NOTE: On most systems there is qmake and qmake-qt4 qmake relates to the old qt version 3 qmake.)
   make
   make install
 
  Note: If you run into compiler problems then edit the file mudlet/src/src.pro in order to 
   change the INCLUDE and/or LIBS part of the make file and set the correct path on your system.



Good Luck.
